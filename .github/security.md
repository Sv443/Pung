# Security Policy
<sup>Last updated: 2021/11/17</sup>

<br>

## Precautions
I use [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) and [LGTM](https://semmle.com/lgtm) to make sure the code doesn't contain known vulnerabilities.  
Additionally, I use [Dependabot](https://dependabot.com/) to ensure no dependencies are outdated or vulnerable.  
  
Still, the security measures aren't impenetrable, so if you notice anything, please refer to this guide:

<br>

## Reporting a Vulnerability
To report a vulnerability or security issue, please directly contact me via [Email](mailto:contact@sv443.net?subject=Pung%20security%20inquiry) or [Discord.](https://dc.sv443.net)  
Please do not create a GitHub issue.
